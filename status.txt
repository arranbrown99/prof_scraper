The code builds properly with stack build, however I couldn't get stack purge to work properly because of a database permission error, so I have just deleted the contents of .stack-work. It should still build after this. Also the coursework handout says to put my student ID in 'project.yaml', I don't have this file so I assume you meant 'package.yaml'.

I have implemented all of the parts of part A, it passes all of the public tests and it returns Nothing if the wrong URL is passed in.

For part B I used cassava in order to write the schools and professor counts into a csv file called "prof_count.csv", this is not included in the zip but will be generated by running stack run. The write to file is done using the bytestring dependency. Csv was used as it is a pretty useful and easy to understand way to store data.
